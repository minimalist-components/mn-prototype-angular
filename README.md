## Demo

If you want view a demo, just clone/fork this repo, and:

```sh
# install dependencies, and prepare theirs to front
npm i && bower i && gulp vendorCSS vendorJS
```

```
# start project in local environment
gulp
```

Important, you need have in your machine `node.js` and `gulp` as global module.
If you dont have any of these, look for the better way to install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), and after done, install `gulp` with `npm i -g gulp`.
